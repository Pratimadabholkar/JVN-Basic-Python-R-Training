# JVN-Basic-Python-R-Training
Basic Python/R for JVN Pre-master

Python is nowadays become an active programming language used for scientic computing, especially it is widely used in data science.  Moreover, Pythonis totally free and prefered by a lot of companies.  Based on this signicantneed, we aim to provide the JVN students the most important knowledgein Python.

# Lecture list

1. Introduction to Python

    * What and Why is Python: the signicance of Python in computer science, data science community and other fields.
    * How to setup and access Python environment (e.g: install, start, stop). Students are required to be familiar with using command line to carry out some code.
    * Simple Python convention (variables, constants, operations) and coding convention (naming variables).
    * Function

2. The Python Standard Library, if/loops statements

    * Some useful and basic built-in functions (abs, etc.)
    * How to use import to import libraries (ex: math, random). We will introduce you several basic libraries that are often used in Python.
    * Introduce Comparison and Boolean Operators (if/else/while/for)
    * Students are also introduced the concept of object-orientation in Python.

3. Vector/matrix structures, `numpy` library

    * Vector/matrix: structures in Python, some built-in functions, Operators for vector/matrix (access, comparation, search)
    * Introduce to module Numpy

4. Python data types, File Processing, `Pandas` library

    * Introduce String/List and basic built-in functions and operators for String/List.
    * Structure of Python files. Read/create a file.
    * Read csv file using \textit{Pandas} library

5. Functions in Python, Debugging.

    * What is functions and how to define functions in Python
    * Passing Arguments to Functions
    * Common errors in Python

6. Introduction to R, R for Python programmers.

    * From Python to R.
    * Variable, using library, function in R

7. Import data, plot data.

    * Read csv file, quick summary.
    * Plot data.

8. Data Mining in Python/R.
